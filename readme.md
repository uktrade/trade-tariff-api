# Taric API

## Overview

This API provides access to Taric XML files that have been generated by the DIT Tariff Application.

Taric files are processed in sequential order so a client system knowing the last file that was imported could retrieve the next file in sequence.

Files are indexed by date to allow the respective file(s) for a particular date (typically yesterday) to be retrieved.

For example:

**DATE**    | **FILE(S)**
---|---
20202-11-02  | 200000, 200001
20202-11-03  | 200002, 200003 
20202-11-04  | 200004
20202-11-07  | 200005

## API endpoints

### taricdeltas -- List files available by date

**/api/v1/taricdeltas/**{date}

{date} defaults to yesterday

{date} must be in YYYY-MM-DD format

e.g.

```
curl localhost:8080/api/v1/taricdeltas

curl localhost:8080/api/v1/taricdeltas/2018-12-01
```
### taricfiles -- Get specific file

**/api/v1/taricfiles/**{sequenceid}

{sequenceid} is a 6 digit number

e.g.
```
curl localhost:8080/api/v1/taricfiles/18004
```


### taricfiles - (Upload) Post specific file

**/api/v1/taricfiles/**{sequenceid}

{sequenceid} is a 6 digit number

{file} as form element

e.g.
```
curl --form file=@/users/dave/downloads/Taric3_files/TGB18146.xml -H "X-API-KEY: def456" localhost:8080/api/v1/taricfiles/18146
```

# Security mechanisms

The API is readable publicly without authentication.

An API key (`X-API-KEY`) is required to upload new files. Access to the upload API endpoint is restricted to a set of whitelisted IPs both by the app and by an IP filtering route service.


# Installation

##  Environment Variables

**NAME**            | **PURPOSE**
---|---
API_ROOT            | URL prefix for serving files
TARIC_FILES_FOLDER  | Location for Taric files (defaults to /)
TARIC_FILES_INDEX   | Location of index file (defaults to /)
API_KEYS            | Comma separated list of API keys that are SHA256 encoded
WHITELIST           | Comma separated list of whitelisted source IP addresses **
APIKEYS_UPLOAD      | Same as API_KEYS above - except these are the keys authorised to upload Taric files
WHITELIST_UPLOAD    | Same as WHITELIST above - except these are the IP addresses whitelisted to upload Taric files
AWS_BUCKET_NAME     | S3 bucket storing the Taric files ***
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID   | S3 Access key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   | S3 Secret

** IP addresses can be a range such as 11.22.33.44/24

*** Storage can be S3 or local - depends on the module used in the build / import - either **apifile.py** _or_ **apifiles3.py**



##  Local Installation
Virtualenv is recommended. `pip-tools` is used to manage live and dev dependencies.

```
$ virtualenv taric-api
$ source taric-api/bin/activate
(taric-api) $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

##  Cloudfoundry Installation
procfile and manifest.yml are provided

Using the Cloudfoundry cli:
```
cf push APP-NAME --no-start
cf set-env APP-NAME API_ROOT "https://APP-NAME.domain"
...
```

## Updating dependencies

Edit `requirements.in` or `requirements-dev.in` and run the following:

```
$ make save-requirements
```

# Linting
`make check` runs a suite of linting tools across the codebase. These checks are enforced through CI.

`pre-commit` is used to help spot problems before committing. Run `pre-commit install --install-hooks` to perform one-off setup of these hooks.

# Testing

The strategy is to use a Unix shell script and curl commands, compare the response codes.

`tests/runtests.sh` checks API response codes against expected. Note that the http header X-Forwarded-For is inserted for local testing. This should be removed when testing via a proxy or in a cloud environment. 

`tests/testserver.sh` is a sample script to start a server locally with environment variables. `tests/start-minio.sh` and `tests/stop-minio.sh` control a MinIO server that is used for providing an S3-compliant backend for the API during tests.

The complete API specification is documented and available in a separate word document.
